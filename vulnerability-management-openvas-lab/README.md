# Vulnerability Management Mini Lab - OpenVAS (Greenbone Community Edition)

## Goal
Demonstrate a basic vuln-management workflow: scan -> triage -> validate -> remediate -> rescan -> report.

## Lab Setup (high level)
- OpenVAS/GVM in Ubuntu VM (Docker)
- Targets:
  - Ubuntu Desktop VM (192.168.56.30)
  - Windows 10 VM (192.168.56.20)
- Scope: internal VirtualBox subnet

## What happened
- First scan produced critical/high package findings on Ubuntu.
- I applied vendor patches (`apt update && apt upgrade`) and rescanned.
- Result: critical/high reduced significantly; remaining findings were mostly configuration/exposure items.
- Note: scans were unstable and reports show "Interrupted at 99%", so I selected a small set of high-confidence findings (high QoD) to document.

## Scope & Limitations
- Scans were executed in an isolated VirtualBox lab subnet (not production).
- Some scans were interrupted at ~99%, so only **high-confidence findings** (high QoD) were selected.
- Findings represent **exposure and configuration risk**, not exploit proof.
- Validation focused on version checks, service exposure, and realistic attack surface.

## Before vs After (evidence)

## Findings (selected, validated examples)
- **Critical:** WebKitGTK / JavaScriptCoreGTK (Ubuntu USN-7395-1)  
  -> [critical-webkitgtk](findings/CRITICAL-webkitgtk.md)
- **High:** libssh (Ubuntu USN-7619-1)  
  -> [high-libssh](findings/HIGH-libssh.md)
- **Medium:** Windows RPC / MSRPC enumeration  
  -> [medium-rpc-135.](findings/MEDIUM-rpc-135.md)
- **Low:** Weak SSH MAC algorithms  
  -> [low-ssh-weak-mac)](findings/LOW-ssh-weak-mac.md)


## How I would report to ops 
- Short, actionable summary per host: what to patch now, what can wait, what needs validation, and what is a policy/hardening decision.
- See: [Reporting templates](templates/)
