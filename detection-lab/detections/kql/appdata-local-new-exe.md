## Summary
Detects first-seen EXE creation under AppData\Local\\\<folder> (user-writable path). Good early signal for payload drops/unpack.

## Why this matters
Attackers commonly drop or unpack binaries in AppData\Local to avoid UAC and blend with user data. Catching the first EXE in a new folder reduces noise and highlights foothold/setup activity.

## Signal logic
- **base** - EXE created under \appdata\local\...; the folderâ€™s first write seen within 10m; excludes common benign folders/creators (lab allowlist).
- **enrichment** - Left-join nearest ProcessCreate (EID 1) for the same PID within 10m to add command_line and parent info.
